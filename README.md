OpenGL/Lua/C++ fractal generator.

Uses GLSL to create interesting looking fractals and other patterns in real time. Initially created around 2010-2011ish, I recently dug it back up and got it to build on Windows instead of Ubuntu 10.4. It's pretty ugly in its current state and has a bunch of weird dependencies I'll need to list. The OpenGL code is pretty old and needs a rewrite, and tons of functionality needs to be gutted in favor of C++11/14 patterns. For now, though, it compiles and seems to work.

I have abandoned this project in favor of a comprehensive rewrite (Refrakt). I'll probably be copying some functionality and ideas from this, but this is how this code will stay as is unless I see something blatantly incorrect.
